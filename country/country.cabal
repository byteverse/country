name: country
version: 0.1.6
synopsis: Country data type and functions
description:
  The `country` library provides a data type for dealing with
  the set of countries as defined by ISO 3166. The representation
  is compact and is well-suited to use with vectors and
  primitive arrays. Additionally, this library exports functions 
  that provide the following encodings and decodings:
  .
  * ISO Alpha-2 (two-letter country code)
  .
  * ISO Alpha-3 (three-letter country code)
  .
  * ISO Numeric (three-digit country code)
  .
  . 
  The main differences between this library and `iso3166-country-codes` are:
  .
  * it doesn't use an ADT to represent countries, instead it uses the country's three-digit country code.
  .
  * it doesn't use `String` for encoding/decoding
  .
  * it provides two-alpha and three-alpha country codes.
  .
  * it provides `Prim` instances from the `primitive` package to allow types to be used in unboxed vectors/arrays.
  .
  * BSD3 licence instead of LGPL
  .
  Please open up an issue on github if there is anything
  you would like to see added.
